Hello,

I am Emre Baspinar. I am a researcher in mathematical and computational neuroscience.
I am currently working in CNRS, Institut des Neurosciences Paris-Saclay (NeuroPSI).
I work on:

- neural population models with applications to pathological and normal brain states

- decision making mean-field and network models

- multiple timescale stochastic dynamical systems and their applications to neuroscience

- complex dynamical systems and their applications to neuroscience

- geometric modeling of visual perception via Lie groups 

- non-linear PDEs for image processing/analysis

- differential geometry

- sub-Riemannian geometry
