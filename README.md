Hello,

I am Emre Baspinar. I am a researcher in mathematical and computational neuroscience.
I am currently working in Inria (Montpellier), within MathNeuro Team as a permanent researcher.
My research is in mathematical and computational neuroscience for pathological and normal 
brain states, and based on mainly three axes:
- mean-field and network neuronal population models for migraine/epilepsy
- differential geometric models for visual perception
- biophysical models for decision-making
